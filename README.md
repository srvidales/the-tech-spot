# The Tech Spot Blog

This application showcases the amazing power of the MVC paradigm by implementing a blog site where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This app has been deployed to heroky for your viewing pleasure. The app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
